# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Correctly

This repository demonstrates a bug where some Tailwind CSS classes are not being applied correctly.  The issue seems to stem from unexpected CSS precedence or conflicts, preventing styles from being properly applied.

## Bug Description

The hover effect on a button is not working.  The background color remains the same when the mouse hovers over the element.

## Solution

The issue is resolved by ensuring the correct order of classes and/or adding !important to override conflicting styles (though this is generally not recommended).  In the bugSolution.js file, I've added `!important` to force the hover style, demonstrating a potential fix. However, investigating the origin of the conflict is necessary for a cleaner solution.  This may involve inspecting CSS specificity and potentially adjusting or removing conflicting styles in your CSS file.
